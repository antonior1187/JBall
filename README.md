# JBall
## Created By Antonio Ruiz using LibGDX
Most of the code is held withing the JBall/core/src/com/mygdx/game/ file where all the creation of this game is made.
Also the Android File, Desktop File, HTML File, and IOS file have Launchers at the /src/com/mygdx/game/ where JBall can be launched by multiple devices.
I'm not sure if it is possible download this game at the momement to other computers but I am working on a solution in order to share my game in the future.
